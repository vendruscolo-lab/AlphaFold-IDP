# AlphaFold-IDP
This repository provides with custom code and analysis scripts to generate structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins by using AlphaFold generated residue distance maps as constraints using prior-structural ensembles.

## Dataset

This repository contains the full code and some small example data to reproduce our results on the kinetic ensemble of amyloid-Î² 42. See also the original implementation of the constrained VAMPNets.
